      Abstract:
        'Mutation testing is an important technique able to evaluate the bug-detection effectiveness of existing software test suites. Mutation testing tools exist for several languages, e.g., Java and JavaScript, but no solutions are available for managing the mutation testing process for entire web applications, in the context of end-to-end (E2E) web testing. In this paper, we propose Mutta, a novel tool able to automate the entire mutation testing process. Mutta mutates the various server source files of the target web application, runs the E2E test suite against the mutated web applications, and finally collects the test outcomes. To evaluate Mutta, we designed a case study using the mutated versions of the target web application with the aim of comparing the effectiveness of two different approaches to E2E web testing: (1) test cases based on classical assertions and (2) test cases relying on differential testing. In detail, Mutta has been executed on two web applications, each equipped with different test suites to compare assertions with differential testing. In this scenario, Mutta generated a large number of mutants (more than 15k overall), took into account the coverage information to consider only the mutants actually executed, deployed the mutated web app, ran the entire E2E test suites (about 87k tests runs overall), and finally, it correctly saved the test suite results. Thus, results of the case study show that Mutta can be successfully employed to automate the entire mutation testing process of E2E web test suites and, therefore, can be used in practice to evaluate the effectiveness of different test suites (e.g., based on different techniques, E2E frameworks, or composed by a different number of test scripts). © 2023, The Author(s).',

      Abstract:
        'The application of test cases for detecting the faults within the software is called software testing. Manual testing is laborious and time-consuming hence automation tools to test software were introduced. Despite the use of automation tools at the User Interface (UI) level of the test pyramid, the limitations of current automation tools like automated test case generation and automated repairing of fragile tests still force us to carry out a large amount of manual testing. In this paper, we propose a novel method using AI to address the given challenges. With our proposed method test cases are automatically generated from the structure of the UI using a pipelined architecture of object detection, text detection and NLP models. We show that the test cases generated by the proposed framework can be translated into executable test scripts using a simple parser. The proposed method generates an average of 98.8% correct executable test cases for the applications under study. We also show the capability of the proposed method in generating new tests automatically when the application is modified. The proposed method generates an average of 98.605% correct executable test cases when the UI is modified for the applications under study. We also empirically prove that a GPU implementation of the proposed framework results in just an additional average runtime of 0.92 seconds per test case which is significantly low given the benefits of automated generation of test scripts and automated repairing of fragile tests. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd',

      Abstract:
        'Assuring quality of web applications is fundamental, given their relevance in the today’s world. A possible way to reach this goal is through end-to-end (E2E) testing, an approach in which a web application is automatically tested by performing the actions that a user would do. With modern web applications (for example, single-page applications), it is of great importance to properly handle asynchronous calls in the test suite. In E2E Selenium WebDriver test suites, asynchronous calls are usually managed in two ways: using thread sleeps or explicit waits. The first is easier to use, but is inefficient and can lead to instability (also called flakiness, a problem often present in test suites that makes us lose confidence in the testing phase), while the second is usually more efficient but harder to use because, if the correct kind of wait is not carefully selected, it can introduce flakiness too. To help Testers, who often opt for the first strategy, we present in this work a tool-based approach to automatically replace thread sleeps with explicit waits in an E2E Selenium WebDriver test suite without introducing new flakiness. We empirically validated our tool named SleepReplacer on four different test suites, and we found that it can correctly replace in an automatic way from 81 to 100% of thread sleeps, leading to a significant reduction of the total execution time of the test suite (i.e., from 13 to 71%). © 2022, The Author(s).',

      Abstract:
        'Web-based applications have complex mechanisms, and it is challenging to perform any test. Computerization examination applies automation tools to decrease individual interference and repeatable assignments. In this article, we have designed and implemented an automation testing framework for web applications. The Selenium WebDriver tool was used to execute this innovative automated testing model. With this structure, testers can match the widgets with pre-trained dataset by taking screenshots of the web pages and by clicking automatically using PyAutoGUI. The screenshot property of the framework is useful to creators for evaluating their design of the web page. We introduced a novel methodology for widget detection, widget classification and testing coverage using machine learning and image processing concept. In this approach, we can give the URL as input, so, the GUI widget images can be quickly captured from the server and do not require large storage repositories to be used as training samples. Widgets of GUI images are detected from the pre-trained datasets by applying BLOB text detection. After identifying the widgets, they are classified into domain-specific categories, for example, labels, buttons, input boxes, check boxes, and links). Finally, it is evaluated to achieve a mean GUI component categorization of superior precision. Previous works have mostly used Java GUIs, Python GUIs, and Visual Basic GUIs to distinguish the types of widgets, but in our work, we observed the types of widgets using Image Processing. From this automated testing implementation on web applications, we have achieved 98.4%. of test coverage accuracy. © 2022 Little Lion Scientific.',

      Abstract:
        'Agile methods and their practices have fostered the widespread presence of automated test cases. Such test cases have been successfully and extensively adopted to test different software levels, from unit tests (e.g., JUnit) to end-to-end Web Graphical User Interface (GUI) tests (e.g., Selenium Webdriver). While test execution is mostly automated by existing tools, test design remains a manual task. In the pursuit of a more automated test case generation approach, the use of models has been advocated by the model-based testing (MBT) technique. Current MBT approaches assume a top-down workflow in which testers design models, test cases are generated from models, and then scripts are written to automate test execution. Nevertheless, writing automated tests is nowadays a developer’s responsibility and testers face a scenario in which automated tests might be reused to produce new model-based tests. This paper aimed to improve the synergy between existing automated tests and MBT. To do so, we present an approach that infers a model from existing tests, a tester leverages this model to include new tests, and then test code is generated. We analyzed the proposed approach in the context of Web applications with system-level GUI tests that employ the Page Object pattern. For MBT, we adopted event-driven models augmented with parameters and test input data. We evaluated the approach’s applicability with a prototype tool called MoLeWe and an experimental study with nine open-source Web applications. The results provide some evidence that using MoLeWe may help to include new tests faster than manually coding them, while increasing the overall code coverage of the test suite. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.',

      Abstract:
        'Selenium WebDriver is a library that allows controlling web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, etc.) programmatically. It provides a cross-browser programming interface in several languages used primarily to implement end-to-end tests for web applications. JUnit is a popular unit testing framework for Java. Its latest version (i.e., JUnit 5) provides a programming and extension model called Jupiter. This paper presents Selenium-Jupiter, an open-source JUnit 5 extension for Selenium WebDriver. Selenium-Jupiter aims to ease the development of Selenium WebDriver tests thanks to an automated driver management process implemented in conjunction with the Jupiter parameter resolution mechanism. Moreover, Selenium-Jupiter provides seamless integration with Docker, allowing the use of different web browsers in Docker containers out of the box. This feature enables cross-browser testing, load testing, and troubleshooting (e.g., configurable session recordings). This paper presents an example case in which Selenium-Jupiter is used to evaluate the performance of video conferencing systems based on WebRTC. This example case shows that Selenium-Jupiter can build and maintain the required infrastructure for complex tests effortlessly. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.',

      Abstract:
        'Aim: This study systematically reviewed the application of ICP-MS and its combined technology in the determination of mineral and heavy metal elements in medicinal materials derived from plants, animals, minerals and their preparations (Chinese patent medicine), and biological products. It provides a reference for improving the quality standard of traditional medicine and exploring the effective components, toxic components, and action mechanism of traditional medicine. Materials and Methods: A total of 234 articles related to the determination of mineral and heavy metal elements in medicinal materials derived from plants, animals, and minerals and their preparations (Chinese patent medicine) were collected from PubMed, CNKI, Web of Science, VIP, and other databases. They were classified and sorted by the inductively coupled plasma-mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS) method. Results: Of the 234 articles, 154 were about medicinal materials derived from plants, 15 about medicinal materials derived from animals, 9 about medicinal materials derived from minerals, 46 about Chinese patent medicine, 10 about combined technology application, and 3 about drugs being tested after entering the body. From the 154 articles on medicinal materials derived from plants, 76 elements, including Cu, Cd, Pb, As, Cr, Mn, and Hg, were determined, of which the determination of Cu was the most, with 129 articles. Medicinal materials derived from the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits and seeds of plants accounted for 25.97%, 18.18%, 7.14%, 7.79%, and 14.94%, respectively. Moreover, medicinal materials derived from the whole plants accounted for 14.94%, and other medicinal materials derived from plants and soil accounted for 11.04%. A total of 137 of the tested medicinal materials were from traditional Chinese medicine, accounting for 88.96%, 12 were from Arabic medicine (including Unani), accounting for 7.79%, 2 were from Tibetan medicine of China, and 1 was from Mongolian medicine of China, 1 was from Miao medicine of China, and 1 was from Zhuang medicine of China. In the 15 articles on medicinal materials derived from animals, 49 elements such as Cu, As, Cd, Hg, Se, Pb, and Mn were determined, of which Cu was the most. All the tested medicinal materials belong to traditional Chinese medicine. From the nine articles on medicinal materials derived from minerals, 70 elements such as Fe, Cu, Zn, Al, As, Se, and Na were determined, of which Fe, Cu, and Zn were the most. The tested medicinal materials all belong to traditional Chinese medicine. From the 46 articles on Chinese patent medicine, 62 elements such as Cu, As, Pb, Cd, Hg, Ni, and Cr were determined, of which Cu was the most. Regarding the tested Chinese patent medicine, 38 articles belong to traditional Chinese medicine, 6 to Tibetan medicine, and 2 to Mongolian medicine of China. Three articles determine the content of metal elements in biological samples such as animal hepatic venous blood, abdominal aortic blood, brain, liver, kidney, urine, and feces, and one article determines the content of metal elements in human lung and serum. From the 10 articles combined with liquid chromatography and gas chromatography, 16 elements such as MMA, DMA, AsIII, AsV, AsB, AsC, and AsI3 were determined, of which MMA and DMA were the most. It can realize elemental morphology and isotope analysis. The tested medicinal materials and Chinese patent medicine belong to traditional Chinese medicine. Conclusion: ICP-MS was applied the most in traditional Chinese medicine, followed by Arabic medicine. ICP-MS was used to determine more medicinal materials derived from plants, and Cu was determined the most. The characteristic inorganic element spectrum of medicinal materials can also be established. ICP-MS and its combined technology are widely used in Chinese patent medicine, but the test of biological samples is the least. The information provided in this article can provide a reference for improving the quality standard of traditional medicines and exploring the active ingredients and toxic ingredients and their mechanism of action.

      Abstract:
        'As a result, a wide variety of methods are used to collect data that counts. All the data collection methods, web scraping is the most reliable and efficient one. Popular test automation framework Selenium can be used to scrape web pages in a variety of ways. In this paper, we demonstrate web page scraping using Python, a popular backend programming language. Test automation frameworks such as Selenium also support it. Information can also be scraped from static web pages. As a result, this paper examines the major advantages and challenges of web scraping in building web applications. The framework is fully functional and can be used by both novice and advanced users to automate the testing of web sites. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2022.',

      Abstract:
        'Web applications are prevalent and considered the mainstay of information systems for organizations. At the same time, web applications are getting more complex, costly for development, and testing. Employees, customers, and business partners rely on these information systems to accomplish their business processes and tasks. Accordingly, users of these web applications assume that these systems are error-free and reliable. Automation testing is imperative to assure regression testing, off-load repetitive tasks from test engineers, and keep the pace between test engineers and developers. Further, it can reveal defects to test engineers at early development stages when parts of the software are broken or changed. Automated tests save time because the case gives the ability to run test cases at night and free testers to perform other types of testing, such as exploratory tests. However, even when using a dedicated automation testing framework, building test cases can be a time-consuming task. In this paper, we provide a solution for generating test cases for web applications. We present a new model-based approach that automatically generates test cases for Selenium testing tool, utilizing Domain-Specific Visual Language (DSVL) and Domain-Specific Textual Language (DSTL). Proof of concept framework is implemented and evaluated to measure user satisfaction, efficiency, and effectiveness of our approach. Our framework, named MAJD, was evaluated through a case study, using 20 tester engineers and developers from the industry with different experience levels. The results show that our framework is efficient and usable. © 2022 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        'Differential testing applied in the Web context compares the current web page under test with a snapshot considered correct taken from a previous version. This technique appears to be promising and an alternative to assertions in catching regressions due to the evolution of the web application under test. This paper empirically compares Selenium WebDriver test scripts equipped with (1) assertions and (2) differential testing implemented in the Recheck tool. The comparison included costs (both test scripts development time and execution time) and effectiveness (bugs detection capability) considering two different versions of differential testing implemented in Recheck, named implicit and explicit. Results show that, on average, Recheck (both explicit and implicit) is able to detect more bugs than classic assertions (up to +34% on complex apps). The development time is similar between the two approaches. The execution time is slightly higher than classic assertions for Recheck explicit (+33%), while it is by far higher when Recheck implicit is adopted (3.6 times). In conclusion, the best choice, considering both the effectiveness and the costs, appears to be Recheck explicit. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.',

      Abstract:
        'Test automation brings several benefits but also presents significant problems that often force developers/testers to carry out tiring and costly manual tasks. Among these tiring tasks while using Selenium WebDriver for testing Web applications, driver management (i.e., version discovery, download, setup and maintenance) ranks in a top position. Recently, an open source Java library, named WebDriverManager, that carries out automatically the driver management process for Selenium WebDriver has been proposed to alleviate the burden of the developers. This library appears to be very promising but until now no one has experimentally evaluated its effectiveness. In this paper, we present an empirical study aimed at understanding whether the use of WebDriverManager allows to reduce both initial and long-term setup efforts of a multibrowser test suite. The results are in favor of WebDriverManager as it allows an average saving of more than 33% of the time for an initial setup which translated annually corresponds to many hours of bare manual driver management to which must be added the hours for understanding that the outdated driver is the cause of the problems reported by the test suite. Having almost weekly, as we estimated, outdated drivers brings also to a reduction in the perceived reliability of E2E test suites. The adoption of WebDriverManager can help to drastically reduce all these problems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.',

      Abstract:
        'Web interface testing is a sort of system testing level and it is laborious if accomplished manually, since it is necessary to map each of the elements that make up the interface with its respective code. Furthermore, this mapping makes test scripts very sensitive to any changes to the interface’s source code. Approaches for automated web testing have been proposed but the use of hyper-heuristics, higher-level search techniques aiming to address the generalization issues of metaheuristics, for web testing are scarce in the literature. In this article we present a multi-objective web testing method, MWTest, which automates the generation of test cases based only on the URL of the web application and a new proposed generation hyper-heuristic, called GECOMBI. The GECOMBI hyper-heuristic takes into account combinatorial designs to generate low-level heuristics to support our goal. Moreover, the implementation of the MWTest method creates a Selenium test script quickly and without human interaction, exclusively based on the URL in order to support the automated execution of test cases too. In our evaluation, we compared GECOMBI to another generation hyper-heuristic, GEMOITO, and four metaheuristics (NSGA-II, IBEA, MOMBI, NSGA-III). Results show superior performance of GECOMBI compared to the other approaches. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.',

      Abstract:
        "End-to-end automated test scripts are a great way to ensure the quality of web applications, but are often perceived as expensive both during their initial development and subsequent maintenance activities. However, maintenance costs can be re-duced when test scripts adopt the Page Object (PO) pattern, a sort of web page facade exposing methods to the test scripts. In this work, we proposed ASSESSOR, a novel tool capable of reducing the effort needed for building PO-based Selenium WebDriver test suites. ASSESSOR allows to simply record the test cases, with only a few additional steps compared to Selenium IDE, and then to automatically generate PO-based WebDriver test suites. The in-depth evaluation performed with four web applications shows that ASSESSOR's adoption allows to reduce the development effort of PO-based web test scripts compared to the classic manual approach: 59% time reduction overall, corresponding to a 2.44 increment in productivity. © 2022 IEEE.",

      Abstract:
        'Automated Web Browsing tools, such as Selenium and headless browsers, are used to collect traffic traces from networked applications, with which statistical models describing the traffic are obtained. However, we show that traces from Selenium and headless browsers have markedly different traffic characteristics than human generated traces, with potential impact on the quality of the obtained models. To overcome this limitation, we propose RLBrowse, an automated web automation framework that imitates human browsing habits by separating web automation from the browser using reinforcement learning. By separating the browser and automation tool, RLBrowse improves on 9 out of the 13 traffic trace features tested. The distribution of packet sizes in a trace improves the most, with a nearly 400 % improvement. We test RLBrowse by collecting a corpus of network packet traces on a set of human-navigated website browsing sessions, and by RLBrowse and Selenium. In the subsequent analysis, we identify key differences in the resulting packet traces. © 2022 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        'Software testing has always been a crucial job in accomplishing and assessing the quality standards of a software product. Software testing is done to confirm the developed software product does what it is expected to do. However, testing is expensive in terms of time, effort, and is quite complicated. Studies report that software testing alone is responsible for almost half of the total budget incurred in software development. Additionally, manual testing is more prone to bugs and creating accurate and reliable software is an open issue. Specialists and experts have been exploring more effective and successful automation techniques for testing to deal with this issue. This paper is an endeavor to review the cutting edge of how machine learning and artificial intelligence have been figured out to automate and streamline software testing processes. It also provides an insight mapping of the research into these fields. Furthermore, a practical study on testing web applications is performed using selenium. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.',

      Abstract:
        'Depression is a serious mental and mood disorder with global health and economic burden. This burden may be overwhelming in low income countries, although there are insufficient data. Most antidepressant formulations are predicated on the monoamine, neuroendocrine and neuro-inflammation hypotheses, with little or no cognizance to other neurochemicals altered in depression. A nutritional strategy with or without conventional antidepressants is recommended, as nutrition plays vital roles in the onset, severity and duration of depression, with poor nutrition contributing to its pathogenesis. This review discusses nutritional potentials of utilizing omega-3 fatty acids, proteins, vitamins, minerals and herbs or their phytochemicals in the management of depression with the aim of reducing depression burden. Literature search of empirical data in books and journals in data bases including but not limited to PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science and Google Scholar that might contain discussions of sampling were sought, their full text obtained, and searched for relevant content to determine eligibility. Omega-3 fatty and amino acids had significant positive anti-depression outcomes, while vitamins and minerals although essential, enhanced omega-3 fatty and amino acids activities. Some herbs either as whole extracts or their phytochemicals/metabolites had significant positive anti-depression efficacy. Nutrition through the application of necessary food classes or herbs as well as their phytochemicals, may go a long way to effectively manage depression. This therefore will provide inexpensive, natural, and non-invasive therapeutic means with reduced adverse effects that can also be applied alongside clinical management. This nutritional strategy should be given more attention in research, assessment and treatment for those with depression and other mental illness in low income countries, especially in Africa. © 2021 The Authors',

      Abstract:
        'Selenium WebDriver is a framework used to control web browsers automatically. It provides a cross-browser Application Programming Interface (API) for different languages (e.g., Java, Python, or JavaScript) that allows automatic navigation, user impersonation, and verification of web applications. Internally, Selenium WebDriver makes use of the native automation support of each browser. Hence, a platform-dependent binary file (the so-called driver) must be placed between the Selenium WebDriver script and the browser to support this native communication. The management (i.e., download, setup, and maintenance) of these drivers is cumbersome for practitioners. This paper provides a complete methodology to automate this management process. Particularly, we present WebDriverManager, the reference tool implementing this methodology. WebDriverManager provides different execution methods: as a Java dependency, as a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool, as a server, as a Docker container, and as a Java agent. To provide empirical validation of the proposed approach, we surveyed the WebDriverManager users. The aim of this study is twofold. First, we assessed the extent to which WebDriverManager is adopted and used. Second, we evaluated the WebDriverManager API following Clarke’s usability dimensions. A total of 148 participants worldwide completed this survey in 2020. The results show a remarkable assessment of the automation capabilities and API usability of WebDriverManager by Java users, but a scarce adoption for other languages. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.',

      Abstract:
        'Modern web applications require long quality assurance sessions to be appreciated by users. Test automation reduces delivery times but requires the development of effective and maintainable test scripts so that the advantages of its use are not lost. The usage of the Page object (PO) pattern has proven to be very effective in GUI testing, however, the manual development of Page objects, a sort of web page facade exposing methods to the test scripts, requires a relevant effort, which is often only repaid during evolution. In this paper, we describe a novel approach, almost totally automated, that takes advantage of the features offered by Selenium IDE for generating more maintainable Selenium WebDriver test scripts and Page objects for web applications. The only manual step required to the tester/developer is to add comments to the Selenese produced by Selenium IDE during registrations through a plugin. The very first estimate we conducted to evaluate our tool-based approach appears to be promising. © 2021 ACM.',

      Abstract:
        "In today's world, websites and web applications have become a necessity for all kinds of businesses and commercial enterprises. Software development is an important step of designing the software, ensuring that the designed software fulfills its practical needs and that it is free of bugs and errors. Software testing plays an important role in the software development life cycle because it contributes to the overall quality of the product. This guarantees the consistency and standard of the applications. It is important to be mindful of time and costs when evaluating a program. Therefore most testers have moved from a manual testing to automated testing to reduce time and cost. Then selecting a software-testing tool for automated testing that best fit a project is important yet a challenging task. The aim of this paper is evaluation and comparison of automation testing tools used for web application testing. In this paper will be analyzed and compared different features of two testing tools: The Katalon Studio and Selenium. © 2021 IEEE.",

This book explains how your React components will be integrated, and how to refactor code to make it more concise and flexible. With TDD you can develop a robust test suite to catch bugs, and develop modular, flexible code. Applying your understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work in the browser you'll build a web application called Bookish using TDD and mainstream React stack technologies such as React, React-router, and Redux. Using higher code quality you'll be able to write executable documentation using Cucumber. This is just one of many essentials in maintaining a practical TDD workflow in your daily workload. Test-Driven Development with React highlights best practices and design patterns that will enable you to write more maintainable and reusable React components. © 2021 by Juntao Qiu.

      Abstract:
        'Automated end-to-end (E2E) Web testing relying on frameworks such as Selenium Web Driver is commonly used to assess the quality of web applications. However, the resulting test scripts may require long execution times, due to their interaction with the browser GUI and backend services. To avoid repeated and costly setup of the Web application state, testers tend to build test suites whose test scripts depend on each other (i.e., one test case sets up the application state expected by another test case). In this paper we present Stile, a tool for the parallel execution of Web test scripts that ensures the compliance of all execution schedules with the dependencies among the involved test scripts, while at the same time minimizing the execution time and the computation time required for such parallel execution. Experimental results show that execution times can be approximately halved thanks to Stile. © 2021 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        'As an important branch of software testing, software automated testing has brought many conveniences to the B/S architecture of Web application software testing. At the same time, it has also put forward new requirements for talents in the field of software testing. It is necessary to understand the theoretical knowledge of software testing and to master the use of software testing tools. Therefore, colleges and universities must adopt a teaching model that combines theory with practice to train more excellent test talents. The online practice system adopts the B/S architecture mode, integrates Spring, SpringMVC, and MyBatis open-source frameworks for system development, realizes the function module of super administrator management background, and supports student users to practice theoretical exercises related to software testing online, and write Web-compliant Selenium test script for applying test questions. The system can refer to the Selenium test script according to the standard and compare the test script submitted by the student user. The Selenium tags, positioning methods, elements, and attribute values are regarded as important scoring objects, and finally, judge and make reasonable scoring feedback. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',

      Abstract:
        'With the growth and wide use of web-based applications in many domains, it is crucial to check their conformance with regards to their requirements. Among the important set of testing types, compatibility testing is of high importance. Indeed, ubiquity is required and the way of interacting with these applications can be performed in many manners. Compatibility testing aims at determining if the web application is proficient enough to run in different browsers, database, hardware, operating system, mobile devices, networks, etc. In this context, one challenge for compatibility testing is how to execute multiple tests cases, in a correct and efficient way, that may cover several environments and functionalities of the tested applications, while reducing the consumed resources and time. In our work, we propose a methodology to efficiently perform compatibility tests through several environments with different versions of operating systems (OS) and browsers. We emphasize on resource consumption improvement by using parallel testing and containerization. © 20th International Conferences on WWW/Internet 2021 and Applied Computing 2021.',

      Abstract:
        'Automatic functional tests are a long-standing issue in software development projects, and they are still carried out manually. The Selenium testing framework has gained popularity as an active community and standard environment for automated assessment of web applications. As a result, the trend setting of web services is evolving on a daily basis, and there is a need to improve automatic testing. The study involves to make the system to understand the experiences of previous test cases and apply new cases to predict the status of test case using Tanh activated Clustering and Classification model (TACC). The primary goal is to improve the model’s clustering and classification output.

      Abstract:
        'The main purpose of this paper is to introduce the application area of GUI test automation to researchers in the document analysis and recognition (DAR) field. Continuous integration (CI) represents the main stream in the field of web application development and reducing the burden of testing has become an important issue. In particular, GUI testing relies on human labor in many cases and test automation in this area is the least advanced. Because web content is essentially a type of “document,” DAR technology is useful for promoting automation in this field. However, there have been few presentations on testing technology at conferences in the DAR field. This may be because researchers in the DAR field do not know much about which types of technologies are required in the field of software testing. We developed X-BROT, which is a tool for automatically determining the compatibility of web applications, and attempted to automate GUI testing. X-BROT can detect degradation by comparing the behaviors of web applications between versions under development. Compatibility verification between web documents is realized using DAR technology. X-BROT has shown nearly 100% accuracy for detecting differences between browsers [1] and it seems to be sufficient for automating testing, but many issues have been pointed out in the field of web application development. This paper describes this feedback and discusses new features that have been developed in response, as well as cases where DAR technology is required for GUI test automation. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.',

      Abstract:
        'Automated software testing has proven its value for software development increasingly over the past few years. Software testing is an important phase in the entire software development process. There are various automated software testing tools are available today, which are used for testing various software applications whether it is desktop-based, mobile application, or a Web-based application. Evaluating a software testing tool is rather a subjective task, depending on the evaluator’s opinions rather than based on the objective approach. For this purpose, we have studied research papers, articles, journals, books, conference papers, few Web sites, etc., related with the study of software testing tools based on which we performed a survey of various automated software testing tools, i.e., Selenium, Watir, QTP, TestComplete, WinRunner, LoadRunner, SilkTest, Apache Jmeter, Wapt, Tellurium, Web Load, NeoLoad, LoadUI, Appvance, rational performance tester, SahiPro, Telerik Test Studio, Ranorex, Storm, Soap UI, TestNG, FitNese, Xebium, etc. The purpose of this research work is to summarize the existing literature and to establish an overview of the existing automated software testing tool to benefit the practice of users and for future research. We are attempting to provide detailed insight into automated software testing tools which can help the tester to choose the tool most suited to test his/her application. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.',

      Abstract:
        "Testing process is an essential part of the software development process as it reveals faults of the system which leads to software reliability improvement. Manual software manual testing is a process which testers discover software's faults by hands. Therefore, any change on the software requires tremendous effort and time to execute test cases such as regression tests. Even though we can utilize automation testing tools to speed up the execution of test cases, experienced testers, who are equipped with automation testing knowledge, are inevitably required. Since novice testers usually consume a significant amount of time to develop test scripts, this paper aims to establish an approach to simplify test scripts generation for web-based applications using URL and XSD as inputs. Our approach elicits input elements from a web page using a provided URL and then analyzes their values using XSD to create test data using boundary value testing technique. This produces test scripts that run under Robot framework. © 2020 ACM.",

      Abstract:
        'Automated web testing is an appealing option, especially when continuous testing practices are adopted. However, web test cases are known to be fragile and to break easily when a web application evolves. The Page Object (PO) design pattern addresses such problem by providing a layer of indirection that decouples test cases from the internals of the web page, where web page elements are located and triggered by the web tests. However, PO development could potentially introduce an additional burden to the already strictly constrained testing activities. This paper reports an empirical investigation of costs and benefits due to the introduction of the PO pattern in web test suite development. In particular, we conducted a family of controlled experiments in which test cases were developed with and without the PO pattern. While the benefits of POs did not compensate for the extra development effort they require in the limited experimental setting of our study, results indicate that when the test suite to be developed is at least 10× larger, test development becomes more efficient with than without POs. © 2020 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        'To enable an effective security test for web applications, we propose a client-side extended finite state machine (EFSM) test case generation approach based on the server-side sensitive path coverage for web applications. According to the EFSM model of clients, this approach takes the server-side sensitive path coverage as a goal and uses the memetic evolutionary algorithm to realize the automatic generation of abstract test cases for web application. Moreover, to solve the unexecutable problem of abstract test cases generated by the model, an automatic construction method of test scripts based on Selenium is proposed. This method proposes an automatic test-script construction method based on Selenium. It employs the spectral clustering algorithm to realize group transitions by analyzing the feature of transitions on the EFSM model. Then, the transition after grouping is mapped onto a test script, forming a script library. As a result, abstract test cases can be converted into actual executable test cases. Experimental results show that the selenium-based automated test-script construction method can solve unexecutable abstract test cases, and the test case generation approach can effectively achieve the server-side sensitive path coverage. © 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of HEU.

      Abstract:
        'In this study, it was investigated that model based software tests have higher coverage rate and faster test process on the system tested than traditional software tests. Comparisons of these two methods were performed and reported on parameters of code line number, actual error detection rate, test run time parameters. In the model based test method, the tests were developed by using Selenium library with Graph Walker tool. In traditional tests, modular tests were preferred and JUnit and TestNG libraries were used. As a result of the comparisons with the specified parameters, it was concluded that the model based test reduces the burden of test formation as predicted and is fast and inclusive. © 2020 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        'Complexity of web systems lead to development processes always more tough to test. Testing phases are crucial in software and system engineering and are known to be very costly. While automated testing methods appear to take over the role of the human testers, the issues of reliability and the capability of the testing method still need to be solved. In our paper, we focus on the automation of functional tests of websites. A single web page may contain a huge set of important functionalities leading to the execution of critical web service operations. Besides, testing all of these functionalities implemented in a web page service is highly complex. Two current popular research areas for automation web-based testing are Codeless Functional Test Automation and Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI) in test automation. We therefore define and implement a framework to figure out how to automate the web service product under test, the machine can detect or predict the change and adapt those changes to suitable generic test cases. In our work, we examine on Selenium and the benefits of using machine learning in automated web application testing. Copyright © 2020 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

      Abstract:
        'In this paper, the authors consider an artificial intelligence technique of providing visual testing, and also the developed system that is integrated into functional automated test suites. Thus carried out monitoring and analyzing of visual changes in the graphical interface of the application under test. A proposed tool is supposed to resolve the existing problems of the traditional snapshot visual testing. Graphical user interface (GUI) testing is a very important testing step for quality control of software applications. The GUI is the central node in the test application, from where all functions are accessed. Thus, it is difficult to thoroughly test programs through their graphical interface, especially because they are designed to work with humans, not machines. In addition, they are inherently non-static interfaces, prone to constant changes caused by functionality upgrades, improved usability, changing requirements or changed contexts. This complicates the development and maintenance of test cases without resorting to time-consuming and costly manual testing. A proposed automated system for web-interfaces visual testing uses computer vision technology as an artificial intelligence technique for visual comparison. A comparative analysis is carried out with the developed interface for testing (in particular, a web page) and the expected mockup with the location of visual elements on the page for example, an interface from the customer). When designing an automated system for web-interfaces visual testing, the programming languages Python, JavaScript, library TensorFlow, testing framework Cypress, and database MySQL were used. © 2020 for this paper by its authors.',

      Abstract:
        'A framework is an amalgamation of integrated tools, libraries, utilities and its coordination to interact with the other automation components. The motive of designing a test automation framework is to implement uniform standards towards automation throughout the organization to achieve the desired outcomes. Test automation framework is required to maintain the standardization of the activities performed to manipulate the operations (addition, modification and deletion) on the test scripts and functions easily, to provide the scalability and reliability. Tools, process and testing team are the three key player of test automation. The proposed framework is based on the consideration of test environment (includes language binding, IDE, automation tools and testing framework). Selenium WebDriver is used as web application automation framework to execute test across multiple browsers that supports multiple operating system with variant programming language. Selection of WebDriver automation tool for this framework is due to their internal architecture to directly communicate with browser for fast execution. The combination of test automation tools (i.e. Java, Eclipse, Selenium and TestNG) makes JEST for designing test automation framework. Both Positive and negative test must be performed to verify functionalities of applications to handle unusual exceptions. © 2020 ASTES Publishers. All rights reserved.',

However, automation is a challenging task especially for tests of user interface, which can be very expensive. [Problem] There are two extreme approaches of structuring the code of test duties for web-applicating, i.e., linear scripting and keyword-driven scripting technique employing the page object pattern. The goal of this research is to compare them focusing on the maintainability aspect. [Method] We develop and maintain two automatic test suites implementing the same test cases for a mature open-source system using these two approaches. For each approach, we measure the size of the testing codebase and the number of lines of code that need to be modified to keep the test suites passing and valid through five releases of the system. [Results] We observed that the total number of physical lines was higher for the keyword-driven approach than for the linear scripting one. However, the number of programmatical lines of code was smaller for the former. The number of lines of code that had to be modified to maintain the tests was lower for the keyword-driven scripting test suite than for the linear-scripting one. We found the linear-scripting technique was more difficult to maintain because the scripts consist only of low-level code directly interacting with a web browser making it hard to understand the purpose and broader context of the interaction they implement. [Conclusions] We conclude that test suites created using the keyword-driven approach are easier to maintain and more suitable for most of the projects. However, the results show that the linear scripting approach could be considered as a less expensive alternative for small projects that are not likely to be frequently modified in the future. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.',

      Abstract:
        'The main intent of performing Software testing is to see that the software system is working as per the user’s requirements. Unit testing is done at the individual unit or at the components level. The main objective of this testing is to validate and ensure that each unit is performing its required function effectively. In case of automated testing, in recent days, many testing tools are available which help developers to perform unit testing in a simpler manner. This paper shows how automated unit testing is performed using different testing tools like JUnit, Selenium with web driver Java and Selenium with python. Regarding the experimental work, different applications were tested with the automated tools and results have been discussed with its code. To ensure reliability on web testing, the application has to be tested with the most suitable test case. With Selenium web driver concept, various User Interfaces are identified with xpath and CSS concept and test scripts ensure that various inputs are navigated between User Interface elements. The Automated software testing process reduces time and makes it more accurate. © BEIESP.',

      Abstract:
        'Cloud Computing is one of the upcoming service. It has providing many services to users along with these services we introduced a new service called Testing as a Service (TAAS) it adds value to the services in Cloud. Generally, web application developers facing difficulties to test their own applications in local host. Because it necessary to check whether their application properly running in different environment it consumes more time and cost for requirements. In this paper We proposed an automatic testing in cloud in which the developers can test their own application in different environment using virtual computing machine in cloud in which selenium web driver can be used to drive the application in specified browser in specified environment. It is necessary for the user to store their test cases to test their application hence for users privacy we are providing client side encryption. Using BEEFISH. We are using a FLASK to create a web application for testing service. © 2019 BEIESP.',

      Abstract:
        'In model-based testing, testing is done using Input Output Transition System (IOTS) or Finite State Machine (FSM). In synchronous testing, it is easy to know the proper sequence of input output of the system under testing, whereas, in asynchronous communication, it is tough to trace the sequences of inputs and outputs. A web application is an example of asynchronous processing, in which input/ output queue management is a common issue for testing in asynchronous JavaScript and XML user interfaces. This article discusses asynchronous testing of web application by taking a Gmail account as a case study. In this article, the web application is partitioned into clusters by determining logical web pages that implement logical functions. The clusters of page objects are represented using finite state machines. From the FSMs, test scenarios are generated. The size of the test cases covering longer paths is decreased by making clusters of states. The authors conduct a queue analysis using a test architecture to investigate the behavior of the system under testing. Finally, the test cases are generated using the Selenium tool.

      Abstract:
        "Flaky tests are a source of frustration and uncertainty for developers. In an educational environment, flaky tests can create doubts related to software behavior and student grades, especially when the grades depend on tests passing. NC State University's junior-level software engineering course models industrial practice through team-based development and testing of new features on a large electronic health record (EHR) system, iTrust2. Students are expected to maintain and supplement an extensive suite of UI tests using Selenium WebDriver. Team builds are run on the course's continuous integration (CI) infrastructure. Students report, and we confirm, that tests that pass on one build will inexplicably fail on the next, impacting productivity and confidence in code quality and the CI system. The goal of this work is to find and fix the sources of flaky tests in iTrust2. We analyze configurations of Selenium using different underlying web browsers and timeout strategies (waits) for both test stability and runtime performance. We also consider underlying hardware and operating systems. Our results show that HtmlUnit with Thread waits provides the lowest number of test failures and best runtime on poor-performing hardware. When given more resources (e.g., more memory and a faster CPU), Google Chrome with Angular waits is less flaky and faster than HtmlUnit, especially if the browser instance is not restarted between tests. The outcomes of this research are a more stable and substantially faster teaching application and a recommendation on how to configure Selenium for applications similar to iTrust2 that run in a CI environment. © 2019 IEEE",

      Abstract:
        'Web applications must be load tested to analyze their behavior under various load conditions. Typically, these load tests are automated using protocol-level HTTP requests (e.g., using JMETER). However, there are several disadvantages to using protocol-level requests for load tests. For example, protocol-level requests are only partially representative of the true usage of a web application, as the web application is not actually executed in a browser. It can be difficult to abstract complex behavior, such as a login sequence, into requests without executing the application. Browser-based load testing can be used as an alternative to protocol-level requests. Using a browser-based testing framework, such as SELENIUM, tests can be executed more realistically - inside a browser. Unfortunately, because a browser instance must be started to conduct a test, browser-based testing has a high performance overhead which limits its applicability for load tests. In this paper, we propose an approach for reducing the performance overhead of running SELENIUM-based load tests. Our approach shares browser instances between test user instances, thereby reducing the performance overhead that is introduced by launching many browser instances during the execution of a test. Our experimental results show that our approach can significantly increase the number of user instances that can be tested on a test machine without overloading the load driver. Our approach and the experiences that we share in this paper can help software practitioners improve the efficiency of their own SELENIUM-based load tests. © 2019 IEEE',

      Abstract:
        "Test automation tools such as Selenium are commonly used for automating end-To-end tests, but when developers update the software, they often need to modify the test scripts accordingly. However, the costs of modifying these test scripts are a big obstacle to test automation because of the scripts' fragility. In particular, locators in test scripts are prone to change. Some prior methods tried to repair broken locators by using structural clues, but these approaches usually cannot handle radical changes to page layouts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called COLOR (correct locator recommender) to support repairing broken locators in accordance with software updates. COLOR uses various properties as clues obtained from screens (i.e., attributes, texts, images, and positions). We examined which properties are reliable for recommending locators by examining changes between two release versions of software, and the reliability is adopted as the weight of a property. Our experimental results obtained from four open source web applications show that COLOR can present the correct locator in first place with a 77%-93% accuracy and is more robust against page layout changes than structure-based approaches. © 2019 IEEE.",

      Abstract:
        'Software companies are more committed to produce more quality software systems with lower costs. Software tested by a separate testing team, more quality is in built. Earlier manual testing was done and now a days due to more complexity in the software to be developed, there is a need for automation of testing. Using automated testing tools like Selenium, GUI testing and Cross Browser testing and Web automation is done more effectively. There is a nned for more skills from the test engineers to perform more effective testing. In this paper we performed Web Automation testing using Selenium web driver Python. The web based application is tested with Selenium web driver with Python code.

      Abstract:
        'Context: As a result of the growth of non-developer users of OSS applications, usability has over the last ten years begun to attract the interest of the open source software (OSS) community. The OSS community has some special characteristics (such as worldwide geographical distribution of both users and developers and missing resources) which are an obstacle to the direct adoption of many usability techniques as specified in the human-computer interaction (HCI) field. Objective: The aim of this research is to adapt and evaluate the feasibility of applying four usability techniques: user profiles, personas, direct observation and post-test information to four OSS projects from the viewpoint of the development team. Method: The applied research method was a multiple case study of the following OSS projects: Quite Universal Circuit Simulator, PSeInt, FreeMind and OpenOffice Writer. Results: We formalized the application procedure of each of the adapted usability techniques. We found that either there were no procedures for adopting usability techniques in OSS or they were not fully systematized. Additionally, we identified the adverse conditions that are an obstacle to their adoption in OSS and propose the special adaptations required to overcome the obstacles. To avoid some of the adverse conditions, we created web artefacts (online survey, wiki and forum) that are very popular in the OSS field. Conclusion: It is necessary to adapt usability techniques for application in OSS projects considering their idiosyncrasy. Additionally, we found that there are obstacles (for example, number of participant users, biased information provided by developers) to the application of the techniques. Despite these obstacles, it is feasible to apply the adapted techniques in OSS projects. © 2018',

      Abstract:
        'Techniques for quality assurance have to deal with the complexity of software systems and the high probabilities of errors appearing in any stage of the software life cycle. Software testing is a widely used approach but, due to the costs involved in this process, development teams often debate its applicability in their projects. In the endeavor to reduce the complexity of this process, this study presents an approach for software development based on Test-Driven Development (TDD) and supported by Model-Based Testing (MBT) tools that allow the automatic generation of test-cases. The approach, called MoFQA (Model-First Quality Assurance), consists of two main aspects: i) a process based on testing techniques, which drives software development defining steps and recommended practices; and ii) a toolset for testers, end-users and stakeholders, which allow them to model system requirements that represent unit and abstract tests for the system and, ultimately, generate executable tests. The tools that MoFQA provides are applicable to web applications. In order to evaluate the usability of MoFQA tools, two preliminary validation experiences were driven and the results are presented. © 2019 Latin American Center for Informatics Studies.

      Abstract:
        'Web application development requires visual compatibility testing (VCT), which verifies if a web page is normally displayed on different types of browsers. In common development procedures, VCT is carried out manually. To reduce cost, VCT automation is one of the most important issues in the field of software development. Although a web page is a kind of electronic document, there have not been many papers focusing on VCT issues in the document analysis and recognition (DAR) field. We have developed a prototype tool to support web application testing. The tool offers two tests: a functional compatibility test (FCT) and a VCT. The FCT examines whether the same action (such as click, browse, or text edit) on a web page causes a compatible action on each browser, and the VCT examines whether the same page displays a similar view on each browser. To detect visual incompatibilities, our tool first extracts the document object model (DOM) structure of a target web page by parsing HTML and obtaining properties of each DOM element from the browsers using the Selenium WebDriver tool [1]. The tool compares the relative position of the DOM elements on the web page and their contents. Our tool detects the differences in relative position of each DOM element and creates cliques of those whose relative positions are qualified as equal. The cliques show distortions in the document layout. Additionally, our tool identifies text images of each DOM element and compares the results between the browsers by looking for garbled characters. In fifteen URLs and four web browsers, we obtained 96% recall and 68% precision for text comparison, and 96% recall and 61% precision for detecting layout incompatibilities. A small pilot study shows that operation time of a web application testing task was reduced by almost 35% using our tool. This study indicates that our tool is effective in reducing the development cost of web applications. © 2019 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        "Test automation tools such as Selenium are commonly used for automating end-to-end tests, but when developers update the software, they often need to modify the test scripts accordingly. However, the costs of modifying these test scripts are a big obstacle to test automation because of the scripts' fragility. In particular, locators in test scripts are prone to change. Some prior methods tried to repair broken locators by using structural clues, but these approaches usually cannot handle radical changes to page layouts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called COLOR (correct locator recommender) to support repairing broken locators in accordance with software updates. COLOR uses various properties as clues obtained from screens (i.e., attributes, texts, images, and positions). We examined which properties are reliable for recommending locators by examining changes between two release versions of software, and the reliability is adopted as the weight of a property. Our experimental results obtained from four open source web applications show that COLOR can present the correct locator in rst place with a 77%-93% accuracy and is more robust against page layout changes than structure-based approaches. © 2019 Japan Society for Software Science and Technology.

      Abstract:
        'Software testing is a process that produces and consumes huge amounts of data. Thus, the test data is usually either gathered manually by the testers or randomly generated by tools. The manual method consumes lot of time and highly depends on the testers’ experience while the random approach faces the problem of redundant test data caused by identical use cases. By leveraging the concept of Model-based testing, this paper provides a novel method of testing to save the cost of manual testing and to increase the reliability of the testing processes. In Model-based testing, test cases and test data can be derived from different models. In this paper, we present a technique to generate test data from UML-based Web Engineering (UWE) presentation model for web application testing by using formal specification and Z3 SMT solver. We also build a model-based testing Eclipse Plug-in tool called TESTGER-UWE that generates test data based on the model of UWE for the web application. We evaluate the proposed methods by applying them to generate test data for an Address Book project of UWE. Experimental results show that our proposed methods can reduce the time significantly when generating test data for automation test tools such as Selenium, Katalon, Unit test, etc. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.',

      Abstract:
        'This paper examines techniques for the model-based testing of web applications and multilingual websites. For this purpose, the simple web game application GuessNumbers is used to explain the essential steps for a model-based test process that applies statistical usage models to generate appropriate test suites. We also discuss methods for performing on-the-fly testing by means of an executable usage model. Model-based techniques that provide graphical representations of usage models make it easy to set the test focus on specific regions of the system under test that shall be tested. In addition, adapted profiles support the selective generation of test suites. We also show how generic usage models that are adapted to specific environments during the test execution, enable multilingual websites to be tested. Using the TestPlayer tool chain, a model-based testing approach is easily done. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.',

      Abstract:
        'This paper examines techniques for the model-based testing of web applications and multilingual websites. For this purpose, the simple web application HelloMBTWorld is used to explain the essential steps for a model-based test process that applies statistical usage models to generate and evaluate appropriate test suites. Model-based techniques that provide graphical representations of usage models allow to set the test focus on specific regions of the system under test that shall be tested. Based on adopted profiles different user groups can be distinguished by different test suites during the test execution. Generic usage models, which are adjusted to specific language environments during the test execution, permit the testing of multilingual websites. Using the Eclipse modeling framework in combination with the TestPlayer tool chain provides a versatile tool environment for model-based testing of web applications and websites.

      Abstract:
        'Web applications are critical assets of our society and thus assuring their quality is of undeniable importance. Despite the advances in software testing, the ever-increasing technological complexity of these applications makes it difficult to prevent errors. In this work, we provide a thorough description of the three open problems hindering web test automation: fragility problem, strong coupling and low cohesion problem, and incompleteness problem. We conjecture that a major breakthrough in test automation is needed, because the problems are closely correlated, and hence need to be attacked together rather than separately. To this aim, we describe NEONATE, a novel integrated testing environment specifically designed to empower the web tester. Our utmost purpose is to make the research community aware of the existence of the three problems and their correlation, so that more research effort can be directed in providing solutions and tools to advance the state of the art of web test automation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.',

      Abstract:
        'Testing is performed to detect or discover the errors and defects of a system. In automated testing, what test cases tester shown only will tested. It will not test new link or new thing but here what we are trying anything is new it can understand from previous experience and try to apply experience to get new results. This approach can be achieved by a three-layer structure: Web scraper, Machine Learning (ML) and Selenium. Web page would be tested and it would be trained to a system from a human perceptive in such a way that the system able to understand what are the test cases that need to be followed for each and every element on the web page and system next time on wards will do sanity and smoke test based on those inputs intelligently going to those elements on the website. System learns what actions to be done for a particular web element like button. The outputs that are able to get it is even classified the kind of output, for example, is error page or is the page is not intended. This approach helps the larger business organization to align themselves more with a creative task in testing rather than doing the human repeated activity. © 2018 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        'Due to the complexity of software systems and the high probabilities of new errors appearing in any stage of the software life cycle, techniques for quality verification are needed. Software testing is a widely used approach but, due to the costs involved in this process, development teams often debate its applicability in their projects. In the endeavor to reduce the complexity of this process, this document presents an approach for software development based in Test-Driven Development (TDD) supported by Model-Based Testing (MBT) tools to allow automatic test-case generation. Besides, a toolkit for the generation of unit and acceptance tests for Web applications is proposed. © 2018 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        "One of the important stages of the Software Development Life Cycle is Software Testing. Currently, we perceive swift progression in web services which represents as a communication interface for several network applications. Several automation testing tools help the tester to do a test on web services or applications. On that point, a great deal of choices is available for testing tools to select. Straight off a day's mobile and Web applications are developed the most and tested. Software developer and tester can easily automate the testing process by saving money, time and human resource. The primary aim of this theme is to offer a comparative study on commercial and open source web automation testing tools which will assist the developers to opt for the appropriate tools as per the demands. © 2018 IEEE.",

      Abstract:
        'Test case recording and playback technology, normally implemented as a test case recorder, has been widely applied in the industry. One of the key research topics is how to determine if a web page has entered a ready state before the recorder can perform the next test command? If a web element is incorrectly selected during playback, the related test command will fail to process. This research puts forward four kinds of automatic waiting mechanism for playing test commands. The experiment result shows that the waiting time can be determined dynamically and automatically, so that testers do not have to manually add waiting commands thereby reducing the time and error of artificial discrimination. The proposed mechanisms were implemented as parts of the SideeX open source web testing software and have been further adopted by the new Selenium IDE and Katalon Recorder. Currently, over 60,000 web testers around the world run the mechanisms. © 2018 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        'Test automation tools are widely adopted for testing complex Web applications. Three generations of tools exist: first, based on screen coordinates; second, based on DOM–based commands; and third, based on visual image recognition. In our previous work, we proposed Pesto, a tool able to migrate second-generation Selenium WebDriver test suites towards third-generation Sikuli ones. In this work, we extend Pesto to manage Web elements having (1) complex visual interactions and (2) multiple visual appearances. Pesto relies on aspect-oriented programming, computer vision, and code transformations. Our new improved tool has been evaluated on two Web test suites developed by an independent tester. Experimental results show that Pesto manages and transforms correctly test suites with Web elements having complex visual interactions and multistate elements. By using Pesto, the migration of existing DOM–based test suites to the visual approach requires a low manual effort, since our approach proved to be very accurate.

      Abstract:
        'Many web applications and software engineering tools such as test generators are not accessible for users who do not use traditional input devices such as mouse and keyboard. To address this shortcoming of current applications, this work leverages recent speech recognition advances to create a browser plugin that interprets voice inputs as web browser commands and as steps in a corresponding test case. In an initial experiment, the resulting Voice Controlled Accessibility and Testing tool (VCAT) prototype for Chrome and Selenium yielded a lower overall runtime than a traditional test creation approach. © 2018 Authors.',

      Abstract:
        'Automating web application testing is a very tricky process due to inherent complexity, dynamic behavior(s) in web pages, differences in the way browsers render the same content (especially on different form factors), and so on. Yet manual testing is not a practical option, and such automation is a must in the interests of effectiveness and efficiency, because of the large number of browsers/devices that users can choose from, and also given the rapid software development cycles of today. This paper discusses our efforts at Varidesk to automate web tests against our main website-which offers many features and content, but is also a true eCommerce site where users from around the globe can purchase a very broad variety of active workspace solutions that we offer. Our solution was developed in-house, from the ground up, and leveraged and extended freely available automation and test libraries such as Selenium WebDriver and NUnit respectively. We talk about the challenges we faced and how we overcame them, as well as provide technical insights on real-world concerns such as managing test brittleness, and integrating the web tests into an existing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Part of the novelty of this paper is that we are also transparent on the rationale behind our decision to build versus buy, and how we managed resources, especially in terms of cost. We also present lessons learned, and encouraged by the success that we have observed, hope that the results will be beneficial to academia and practitioners alike. © 2018 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        'Web based applications are gaining widespread popularity and most of these applications are being developed using agile development methods mainly scrum. This invariably makes the testing of any web application necessary and important before it goes online. Agile methods advocate automated testing, which is the only way to assure faster thorough testing of any web application. In this paper, authors propose a reusable hybrid test automation framework (RHTAF) using page object model for automated testing of web applications. RHTAF combines the features of both data driven and keyword driven frameworks and developed using Selenium 2.0 tool. The primary focus of this framework is to ensure reusability and maintainability of test scripts so as to speed up the testing process of web applications. © 2018 Journal of Applied Science and Engineering.

      Abstract:
        'Web applications pervade our life, being crucial for a multitude of economic, social and educational activities. For this reason, their quality has become a top-priority problem. End-to-End testing aims at improving the quality of a web application by exercising it as a whole, and by adopting its requirements specification as a reference for the expected behaviour. In this paper, we outline a novel approach aimed at generating test scripts for web applications from either textual or UML-based requirements specifications. A set of automated transformations are employed to keep textual and UML-based requirements specifications synchronized and, more importantly, to generate End-to-End test scripts from UML artefacts. © 2017 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        'Modern web applications are characterized by ultra-rapid development cycles, and web testers tend to pay scant attention to the quality of their automated end-to-end test suites. Indeed, these quickly become hard to maintain, as the application under test evolves. As a result, end-to-end automated test suites are abandoned, despite their great potential for catching regressions. The use of the Page Object pattern has proven to be very effective in end-to-end web testing. Page objects are façade classes abstracting the internals of web pages into high-level business functions that can be invoked by the test cases. By decoupling test code from web page details, web test cases are more readable and maintainable. However, the manual development of such page objects requires substantial coding effort, which is paid off only later, during software evolution. In this paper, we describe a novel approach for the automatic generation of page objects for web applications. Our approach is implemented in the tool Apogen, which automatically derives a testing model by reverse engineering the target web application. It combines clustering and static analysis to identify meaningful page abstractions that are automatically turned into Java page objects for Selenium WebDriver. Our evaluation on an open-source web application shows that our approach is highly promising: Automatically generated page object methods cover most of the application functionalities and result in readable and meaningful code, which can be very useful to support the creation of more maintainable web test suites. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.',

      Abstract:
        'This article proposes an approach to generate test cases from BPMN models, for automated testing of Web applications implemented with the support of BPM suites. The work is primarily focused on functional testing and has the following objectives: (i) identify execution paths from the flow analysis in the BPMN model and (ii) generate the initial code of test scripts to be run on a given Web application testing tool. Throughout the article, we describe the design and implementation of a solution to achieve these goals, targeting automated tests using Selenium and Cucumber as tools. The approach was applied to processes from a public repository and was able to generate test scenarios from different BPMN models. © 2017 IEEE.',

        "With the transition towards web based solutions, applications are placed within the browser, thus limiting their access to the user's system. Web applications that require unrestrained access to the user's system are often paired up with desktop counterparts, forcing the user to use two different applications instead of one. In this paper we describe the utilization of an embedded java applet, in order to gain unrestrained access to the user's system and use it for the execution of automatic tests. © 2015 IEEE.",

      Abstract:
        "Software Testing is an important process to assure the quality of software including web-based application. The aim of testing is to detect all failures to ensure that the software is built in accordance with its specifications. There are two methods of testing, such as the white box and the black box testing. White box testing is done with the approach to the program code, while black box testing is done without referring to the source code, but to the output of the resulting program. User interface testing is the type of testing that is usually conducted on a web-based application. In this research, functional and user interface testing were conducted into Del's Student Information System. Testing techniques used in this research was a Simple Functional Acceptance Test (FAST). This technique was done by testing each function and checking each component of the user interface. Selenium IDE was used to execute test cases resulting in the implementation. From all steps carried out in this research, it can be concluded that the functional testing can be carried out in line with the testing of the user interface. A testing scenario for web-based application has been proposed and experimentally applied into an application under testing.",

      Abstract:
        'Nowadays, with the rise of mobile devices, users deal with applications that present user interfaces adapted to different contexts of use. In order to improve the quality of these user interfaces, we propose a solution that includes a higher level description of tests and a tool, called Segen, for generating test cases for two very known test automation tools for Web and mobile environments: Selenium and Selendroid. Segen allows to generate test scripts from a single high-level description to executable tests scripts for each environment. On using Segen, testers can focus on the test cases, independently of the environment being used. A proof of concept was used to evaluate Segen: A smart home energy management that has a Web version and a mobile Android version. The evaluation showed that Segen reduces the work of testers and can be used along with other testing libraries. The evaluation also showed that Segen is more useful if test cases are designed before the development. However, it was identified that Segen has similar limitations to those that Selenium and Selendroid have. © 2016 ACM.',

      Abstract:
        'The SmartDriver framework is an open extension of Selenium WebDriver framework aimed at decreasing implementation and maintenance costs of automated tests. It composes from two principal modules working in synergy. The structuring module ensuring three layer architecture of reusable objects, page objects and tests. Besides decreasing of implementation and maintenance costs, this module allows to create tests which can be easily read by testers or business analysts without previous extensive programming knowledge. The maintenance module then decreases time needed to update the scripts. When a test fails when locating a page element which does not exist due to obsolete test script, SmartDriver automatically analyzes if the element has been just moved to another place in the page. If so, it gives this information to the script developer. © 2016 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        'This paper illustrates the design and implementation of a generic framework that can be used to enhance the capabilities of an existing automation test framework. This generic framework is used to support parsing test data, from files of all formats which are often used in the test execution phase. The paper distinguishes the test phase into a pre-execution, execution and validation, and post-execution phase. The generic framework employs web services to parse the test data from different file types into a JSON output array in the pre-execution phase, uses a validation JSON to validate the test results from multiple sources during the test execution phase and subsequently implements the web-service to update test results from files (supporting different formats) into the database thus facilitating, publishing results onto a comprehensive dashboard. The method of implementing this generic framework as a plugin, further enables different automation teams to leverage a single test automation framework to execute multiple test cases independently with different types of inputs irrespective of the applications in test and eventually showcasing all the test results onto a common dashboard for analysis and tracking purposes. © 2015 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        'This paper presents the design, implementation, and applications of a software testing tool, TAO, which allows users to specify and generate test cases and oracles in a declarative way. Extended from its previous grammar-based test generation tool, TAO provides a declarative notation for defining denotational semantics on each productive grammar rule, such that when a test case is generated, its expected semantics will be evaluated automatically as well, serving as its test oracle. TAO further provides a simple tagging mechanism to embed oracles into test cases for bridging the automation between test case generation and software testing. Two practical case studies are used to illustrate how automated oracle generation can be effectively integrated with grammar-based test generation in different testing scenarios: locating fault-inducing input patterns on Java applications; and Selenium-based automated web testing. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd',

      Abstract:
        "Automated test scripts are used with success in many web development projects, so as to automatically verify key functionalities of the web application under test, reveal possible regressions and run a large number of tests in short time. However, the adoption of automated web testing brings advantages but also novel problems, among which the test code fragility problem. During the evolution of the web application, existing test code may easily break and testers have to correct it. In the context of automated DOM-based web testing, one of the major costs for evolving the test code is the manual effort necessary to repair broken web page element locators - lines of source code identifying the web elements (e.g. form fields and buttons) to interact with. In this work, we present Robula+, a novel algorithm able to generate robust XPath-based locators - locators that are likely to work correctly on new releases of the web application. We compared Robula+ with several state of the practice/art XPath locator generator tools/algorithms. Results show that XPath locators produced by Robula+ are by far the most robust. Indeed, Robula+ reduces the locators' fragility on average by 90% w.r.t. absolute locators and by 63% w.r.t. Selenium IDE locators. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

      Abstract:
        'We are moving towards a general public where web is the need of hour. Today the vast majority of the product applications executed, are composed as online applications which are keep running in a web program. Testing programming applications is critical. Numerous associations make utilization of a specific web application, so the same web applications are tried habitually by diverse clients from distinctive regions physically. Testing a web application physically is tedious, so we go for test automation. In test automation we make utilization of a product device to run repeatable tests against the application to be tried. There are various focal points of test automation. They are exceptionally exact and have more prominent preparing pace when contrasted with manual automation. There are various open source and business devices accessible for test mechanization. Selenium is one of the broadly utilized open source device for test computerization. Test automation enhances the effectiveness of programming testing procedures. Test automation gives quick criticism to engineers. It additionally discovers the imperfections when one may miss in the manual testing. In test automation we can perform boundless emphases for testing the same example of code ceaselessly commonly. © 2015 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        'Using formal specifications to generate test cases presents great potential for automation in testing and enhancing the quality of test cases. However, an important challenge in this direction is the design specifications which are at a more abstract level than the implementation, with many important implementation level details missing. To generate executable test cases, these implementation details must be included at some stage. Though there has been a lot of work in test generation from specification, all the existing methods suffer from this problem: either the test cases are not executable, or the process involves a non-trivial, manual step of translating the abstract test cases to concrete test cases. In this work, we present an approach of specification based test generation for web applications that overcomes the above challenge: test generation is completely automated and the test cases are fully executable on a test execution framework (e.g. Selenium RC). Further, our methodology allows generation of multiple sets of concrete test cases from the the same formal specification. This makes it possible to use the same abstract specification to generate test cases for a number of versions of the system. Throughout the paper, a case study of Learning Management System is used to illustrate our approach. Copyright © 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved.',

        "As web applications are becoming more and more ubiquitous, modeling and testing web applications correctly is becoming necessary. In this paper, we have used a formal specification language, State chart to model the navigation behaviour aspect of web applications. This paper presents the ACT (Abstract to Concrete Tests) tool, an approach of generating concrete executable Selenium RC JUnit test cases from a formal State chart specification model. The ACT tool can generate concrete Selenium RC JUnit test cases from abstract test cases by utilizing data shared across different interactions of the web application with the web server.

      Abstract:
        'The importance of test automation in web engineering comes from the widespread use of web applications and the associated demand for code quality. Test automation is considered crucial for delivering the quality levels expected by users, since it can save a lot of time in testing and it helps developers to release web applications with fewer defects. The main advantage of test automation comes from fast, unattended execution of a set of tests after some changes have been made to a web application. Moreover, modern web applications adopt a multitier architecture where the implementation is scattered across different layers and run on different machines. For this reason, end-to-end testing techniques are required to test the overall behavior of web applications.In the last years, several approaches have been proposed for automated end-to-end web testing and the choice among them depends on a number of factors, including the tools used for web testing and the costs associated with their adoption. They can be classified using two main criteria: the first concerns how test cases are developed (ie, Capture-Replay and Programmable approaches), while, the second concerns how test cases localize the web elements to interact with (ie, Coordinates-based, DOM-based, and Visual approaches), that is what kind of locators are used for selecting the target GUI components.For developers and project managers it is not easy to select the most suitable automated end-to-end web testing approach for their needs among the existing ones.

      Abstract:
        'Page Object is a design pattern aimed at making web test scripts more readable, robust and maintainable. The effort to manually create the page objects needed for a web application may be substantial and unfortunately existing tools do not help web developers in such task.In this paper we present APOGEN, a tool for the automatic generation of page objects for web applications. Our tool automatically derives a testing model by reverse engineering the target web application and uses a combination of dynamic and static analysis to generate Java page objects for the popular Selenium WebDriver framework. Our preliminary evaluation shows that it is possible to use around 3/4 of the automatic page object methods as they are, while the remaining 1/4 need only minor modifications. © 2015 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        'Functional test automation is increasingly adopted by web applications developers. In particular, 2nd generation tools overcome the limitations of 1st generation tools, based on screen coordinates, by providing APIs for easy selection and interaction with Document Object Model (DOM) elements. On the other hand, a new, 3rd generation of web testing tools, based on visual image recognition, brings the promise of wider applicability and simplicity. In this paper, we consider the problem of the automated creation of 3rd generation visual web tests from 2nd generation test suites. This transformation affects mostly the way in which test cases locate web page elements to interact with or to assert the expected test case outcome. Our tool PESTO determines automatically the screen position of a web element located in the DOM by a DOM-based test case. It then determines a rectangle image centred around the web element so as to ensure unique visual matching. Based on such automatically extracted images, the original, 2nd generation test suite is rewritten into a 3rd generation, visual test suite. Experimental results show that our approach is accurate, hence potentially saving substantial human effort in the creation of visual web tests from DOM-based ones. Copyright 2015 ACM.',

      Abstract:
        'Nowadays, number of software system has been implemented as web-based applications. These web applications are very complex. It is very difficult to test such complex web applications. Automation testing uses automation tools to reduce human intervention and repeatable tasks. In this paper we have designed and implemented automation testing framework for testing web applications. This new automation testing framework has been implemented using selenium WebDriver tool. Using this framework tester can easily write their test cases efficiently and in less time. Tester need not to study the selenium webdriver tool in detail. This framework is helpful to developer to analyze their code due to screen shot property of framework. This framework produces the customized test report to tester. It is very easy to maintain and repair the test suite for new release of the application using this framework. © 2015 The Authors.

        'Testing is an important aspect in object oriented programming. Testing is done in three levels namely Unit, Integration and System. Testing is also classified into three main strategies, they are Structural, black-box, error-driven strategies. In this project, we propose an object-oriented testing technique “Mutation” and object oriented metrics are implemented using Selenium tool and a data mining application that will test the object oriented code to reduce the time complexity and increase the performance of the software. Mutation way of examining is utilized to create new software test cases and to examine the quality of already existing programs. Selenium tool is an open source technology it will automate web applications for testing purpose. It provides a set of various software equipments each with a different way to support testing that is generated automatically. The proposed System Implement the selenium tool into the mutation testing to test the object oriented coding. © Research India Publications.',

      Abstract:
        "Functional testing requires executing particular sequences of user actions. Test automation tools enable scripting user actions such that they can be repeated more easily. SELENIUM, for instance, enables testing web applications through scripts that interact with a web browser and assert properties about its observable state. However, little is known about how common such tests are in practice. We therefore present a cross-sectional quantitative study of the prevalence of SELENIUM-based tests among open-source web applications, and of the extent to which such tests are used within individual applications. Automating functional tests also brings about the problem of maintaining test scripts. As the system under test evolves, its test scripts are bound to break. Even less is known about the way test scripts change over time. We therefore also present a longitudinal quantitative study of whether and for how long test scripts are maintained, as well as a longitudinal qualitative study of the kind of changes they undergo. To the former's end, we propose two new metrics based on whether a commit to the application's version repository touches a test file. To the latter's end, we propose to categorize the changes within each commit based on the elements of the test upon which they operate. As such, we are able to identify the elements of a test that are most prone to change. © 2014 IEEE.",

      Abstract:
        'Automated testing of web applications reduces the effort needed in manual testing. Old 1st generation tools, based on screen coordinates, produce quite fragile test suites, tightly coupled with the specific screen resolution, window position and size experienced during test case recording. These tools have been replaced by a 2nd generation of tools, which offer easy selection and interaction with the web elements, based on DOM-oriented commands. Recently, a new 3rd generation of tools came up based on visual image recognition, bringing the promise of wider applicability and simplicity. A tester might ask if the migration towards such new technology is worthwhile, since the manual effort to rewrite a test suite might be overwhelming. In this paper, we propose PESTO, a tool facing the problem of the automated migration of 2nd generation test suites to the 3rd generation. PESTO determines automatically the screen position of each web element located on the DOM by a 2nd generation test case. It then calculates a screenshot image centred around the web element so as to ensure unique visual matching. Then, the entire source code of the DOM-based test suite is transformed into a visual test suite, based on such automatically extracted images and using specific visual commands. © 2014 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        "In today's 21st century era countless software applications are written as a web based application which runs in a web browsers. With new technologies and commercialization of I.T. sector, the web based system has undergoes frequent and rapid changes. Today Softwares are coded as a web based application, which help to access data from any part of the globe. Even the economic relevance of web based enhances the control and quality of software. The quality assurance of any system depends on its test. But to do manually testing in most of the cases is time consuming, expensive and hectic. For the better business purpose and to save time and money automation testing is required. There are variety of tools are available in the market for this. One of the best known tool is selenium suite which is a combination of different automation testing tool. In this paper we will discuss about the selenium suite. It provides testers with different framework for different test cases. The main objective of this paper is to find the best tool in selenium suite and then compare it with some other tool for same task. For this purpose, performance evaluation is done on the basis of some criteria. © 2014 IEEE.",

      Abstract:
        'To test web applications, developers currently write test cases in frameworks such as SELENIUM. On the other hand, most web test generation techniques rely on a crawler to explore the dynamic states of the application. The first approach requires much manual effort, but benefits from the domain knowledge of the developer writing the test cases. The second one is automated and systematic, but lacks the domain knowledge required to be as effective. We believe combining the two can be advantageous. In this paper, we propose to (1) mine the human knowledge present in the form of input values, event sequences, and assertions, in the human-written test suites, (2) combine that inferred knowledge with the power of automated crawling, and (3) extend the test suite for uncovered/unchecked portions of the web application under test. Our approach is implemented in a tool called TESTILIZER. An evaluation of our approach indicates that TESTILIZER (1) outperforms a random test generator, and (2) on average, can generate test suites with improvements of up to 150% in fault detection rate and up to 30% in code coverage, compared to the original test suite. © 2014 ACM.',

      Abstract:
        'Testing of user interfaces of web applications has not yet received enough attention. One reason might be the lack of appropriate methodology and tool support. In this paper, we present a systematic approach for test design, implementation and execution of web applications. Instead of error prone capture and replay tools, we use Selenium in a custom framework to extract details of the system under test automatically. The classification tree method in terms of combinatorial test is then used for a systematic test design. Obtained test cases are executed using our custom framework again. This allows for a both, flexible and systematic test approach. We evaluate our approach and framework using a set of experiments. Our results indicate the applicability of approach and tool.',

      Abstract:
        'This paper presents an approach to performing automated functional testing in database-driven application. The goal is to provide test scripts that check contents in databases after CRUD (create, retrieval, update, and delete) operations using a software application. Based on automation tools already developed that test graphical user interface (GUI) elements, new assert functions were proposed and implemented to check data in databases. An instantiation of the proposed approach is described extending the Selenium RC tool to perform automated tests in web applications checking data stored in the database. A case study is described to analyze the impact of the proposed approach in terms of effort and rate of automation in the testing for a database-driven application. The results suggest a significant reduction (91% and 88%) in the effort to execute automated tests in database when compared to, respectively, manual and semi-automated execution.',

      Abstract:
        'In future Cloud ecosystems, brokers will mediate between service providers and consumers, playing an increased role in quality assurance, checking services for functional compliance to agreed standards, among other aspects. To date, most Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) testing has been performed manually, requiring duplicated effort at the development, certification and deployment stages of the service lifecycle. This paper presents a strategy for achieving automated testing for certification and re-certification of SaaS applications, based on the adoption of simple state-based and functional specifications. High-level test suites are generated from specifications, by algorithms that provide the necessary and sufficient coverage. The high-level tests must be grounded for each implementation technology, whether SOAP, REST or rich-client. Two examples of grounding are presented, one into SOAP for a traditional web service and the other into Selenium for a SAP HANA rich-client application. The results demonstrate good test coverage. Further work is required to fully automate the grounding. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.',

      Abstract:
        "Web developers often write test cases manually using testing frameworks such as Selenium. Testing JavaScript-based applications is challenging as manually exploring various execution paths of the application is difficult. Also JavaScript's highly dynamic nature as well as its complex interaction with the DOM make it difficult for the tester to achieve high coverage. We present a framework to automatically generate unit test cases for individual JavaScript functions. These test cases are strengthened by automatically generated test oracles capable of detecting faults in JavaScript code. Our approach is implemented in a tool called Pythia. Our preliminary evaluation results point to the efficacy of the approach in achieving high coverage and detecting faults. © 2013 IEEE.",

      Abstract:
        'During the development process of Web application, two essential phases are software testing and code refactoring. However, automatic testing script plays an important role in test automation. It has been a hot research topic in Web application. In order to refactor the JavaScript code of Web application more conveniently, an approach to automatic script generation from the defined test case is introduced in this paper. First, it describes the test case using customized XML format. Then, since Selenium platform supports multi-browsers testing, a method to transform XML description into test scripts based on Selenium framework is proposed as the emphasis. © 2013 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        "This paper presents one extension of the Selenium RC tool to perform tests in web applications that require checking data in databases. This verification is performed using new functions implemented into the Selenium framework's core. These functions allow opening and closing database connection and comparing test data with data stored in the database used by the web application. This solution aims to contribute to the system quality by reducing the effort during the testing process, since the verification of UI and database elements will be performed at the same time during execution of the test scripts. A case study is described to analyze the impact of the proposed tool in terms of effort and rate of automation in the development of a new web application project. The results suggest a significant reduction (92% and 88%) in the effort to execute automated tests in database when compared to, respectively, manual and semiautomated execution. © 2013 IEEE.",

        "The page object pattern is used in the context of web testing for abstracting the application's web pages in order to reduce the coupling between test cases and application under test. This paper reports on an industrial case study in a small Italian company (eXact learning solutions S.p.A.) investigating the potential benefits of adopting the page object pattern to improve the maintainability of Selenium Web Driver test cases. After a maintenance/evolution activity performed on the application under test, we compared two equivalent test suites, one built using the page object pattern and one without it. The results of our case study indicate a strong reduction in terms of time required (by a factor of about three) and number of modified LOCs (by a factor of about eight) to repair the test suite when the page object pattern is used. © 2013 IEEE.",

      Abstract:
        'There are several approaches for automated functional web testing and the choice among them depends on a number of factors, including the tools used for web testing and the costs associated with their adoption. In this paper, we present an empirical cost/benefit analysis of two different categories of automated functional web testing approaches: (1) capture-replay web testing (in particular, using Selenium IDE); and, (2) programmable web testing (using Selenium WebDriver). On a set of six web applications, we evaluated the costs of applying these testing approaches both when developing the initial test suites from scratch and when the test suites are maintained, upon the release of a new software version. Results indicate that, on the one hand, the development of the test suites is more expensive in terms of time required (between 32% and 112%) when the programmable web testing approach is adopted, but on the other hand, test suite maintenance is less expensive when this approach is used (with a saving between 16% and 51%). We found that, in the majority of the cases, after a small number of releases (from one to three), the cumulative cost of programmable web testing becomes lower than the cost involved with capture-replay web testing and the cost saving gets amplified over the successive releases. © 2013 IEEE.',

      Abstract:
        'WebMole is a browser-based tool that automatically and exhaustively explores all pages inside a web application. Contrarily to classical web crawlers, which only explore pages accessible through regular <a> anchors,WebMole can find its way through Ajax applications that use JavaScript-triggered links, and handles state changes that do not involve a page reload. User-defined functions called oracles can be used to bound the range of pages explored by WebMole to specific parts of an application, as well as to evaluate Boolean test conditions on all visited pages. Overall, WebMole can prove a more flexible alternative to automated testing suites such as Selenium WebDriver.',

      Abstract:
        'Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop and test a web-based application for the dietary management of patients with diabetic nephropathy. Design: Observational descriptive study. Settings and subjects: RenalSmart® is a web-based application used to assist dietitians in clinical practice, from tertiary to primary care, to manage patients with chronic renal failure. The application was adapted and enhanced to include functions for the nutritional assessment of a patient with diabetic nephropathy, the formulation of a dietary prescription and the development of a meal plan and sample menu. It includes a graphical display of anthropometric and biochemical measurements. Quality assurance testing was undertaken throughout the development process by the project team in a pilot study involving generalist dietitians and dietitians who specialise in diabetic and renal nutrition. Non-random purposive sampling, including snowball sampling, was used to recruit them. Outcome measures: The application was finally tested for accuracy and acceptability by registered dietitians in South Africa. Results: Thirty-seven dietitians completed the final testing of the application. The mean age of the respondents was 33 years. Thirty-five per cent resided in the Western Cape. The overall acceptability of the application was rated as good to excellent by 81% of respondents. There was a significant difference between dietitians who usually consulted renal patients, compared to those who did not, in their rating of the accuracy of the data-saving function (p-value = 0.02) and the fluid requirements (p-value = 0.03). In this regard, the former group of dietitians was dissatisfied with these functions. Conclusion: The web-based application developed in this study was rated as accurate and acceptable by the majority of respondents. Identified problem areas were addressed in the final version. © SAJCN.',
